# MIST 353 Assignment 2: Prototype Development and Research for Web Application

## 1. Complete a Competitive Analysis
- Website 1
	- [WeatherPlanner.com](https://weatherplanner.com/weather/index.php)
	- This first website I found quite quickly after searching google for an "event planning weather app" and immediately 
	  realized how similar this site looks to the travel site that we've been working on in class. After exploring their
	  website for a few minutes I noticed that they have a few more pages than we added in class, for example they have 
	  an "About" tab, as well as a "Plannability Factor" tab that lists reasons why their weather planning app is useful. 
	  I thought these two tabs provided helpful info and I'd like to include something similar in my web app in the future.
	- looking at the site's source code revealed that this site's index page was written in 
	- NOTICE ANY URL CHANGES OR SIGNIFICANCE OF ? OR # IN URL

**4. Document with a README**
I used the [Quickstart for writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) for Markdown ideas.
MAYBE INCLUDE A TABLE HERE TO RANK PRIORITIES OF WORK ITEMS 
MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE CITATION
